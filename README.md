SQRL is a Safe, Stateful Rules Language for Event Streams

**Instant** – New features and rules can be deployed to production in seconds.

**Inclusive** – Non-technical users can review and safely deploy changes to production without talking to an engineer.

**Powerful** – Rules can declaratively aggregate state, trigger side effects, and call functions in other languages.

**Auditable** – It’s easy to understand why a rule fired or a side effect occured, and rules can be safely replayed.

## Early Preview

This is an early preview of the SQRL (Smyte Query and Rules Language) open-source release. This release is intended to onboard existing community members and prepare us for a full release in the near future. Through SQRL, we hope to partner with the open source community, and help better address spam on all websites.
