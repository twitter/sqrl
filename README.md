## What is SQRL?

The Smyte Query and Rules Language (SQRL) is a Safe, Stateful Rules Language for Event Streams

**Instant** – New features and rules can be deployed to production in seconds.

**Inclusive** – Non-technical users can review and safely deploy changes to production without talking to an engineer.

**Powerful** – Rules can declaratively aggregate state, trigger side effects, and call functions in other languages.

**Auditable** – It’s easy to understand why a rule fired or a side effect occurred, and rules can be safely replayed.
