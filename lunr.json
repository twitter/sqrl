Limitations on expressions in WHERE statements In order to provide automatic counters and other similar features, we impose some limitations on the syntax you are allowed to use inside a where statement. This is restricted to the following operations: Features, and unary NOT (i.e. WHERE IsLogin , WHERE NOT IsSignup ) Boolean AND / OR (i.e. WHERE IsSignup AND TrustedIp , WHERE (X AND Y) OR Z ) Equality ( = ) / inequality ( != ) to constants (i.e. WHERE Username=&#x201D;josh&#x201D; , WHERE Ip!=&#x201D;127.0.0.1&#x201D; &#x201C;) Counter values For most counters SQRL will only track the counts that exist in the source code. It is important to identify how counters are uniquely identified in SQRL to avoid unintentionally changing the identification of a counter (and losing all previous values). For example the following two counters are maintained separately: 1 2 LET LoginCount := count(BY SessionActor WHERE Event=login); LET PurchaseCount := count(BY SessionActor WHERE Event=purchase); This is to be expected. LoginCount is a count of logins, while PurchaseCount is a count of purchases. Internally we track the features used in the WHERE statement and use them to identify the counter. Using Event directly in count() is not recommended though, because in future you may wish to add a new action mobile_login , or perhaps change login to logged_in . Changing the constant in the Event=X where clause would use a new set of counters. Instead we recommend you use additional feature: 1 2 LET IsLogin := Event = login; LET LoginCount := count(BY SessionActor WHERE IsLogin); With this change later we can safely update IsLogin. 1 2 LET IsLogin := Event IN [login, mobile_login]; LET LoginCount := count(BY SessionActor WHERE IsLogin); In the above case since the body of the WHERE clause did not change any previous tracked counts under the login event will still exist.

Rate limiters limit the number of times an action can be performed over a certain time period. By combining multiple features together, rate limiters become quite powerful. Your first rate limiter A good first rate limiter is limiting the number of signups that can come from an individual IP address. You can begin by editing rules/actions/signup.sqrl (or the equivalent rules file for your signup action) and adding a rate limiter: 1 2 CREATE RULE QuickSignupsByIp WHERE rateLimited(BY Ip MAX 3 EVERY 10 MINUTES); The rateLimited function checks if the ratelimit has been hit. It has quite a few different options available. The ones in use here are: BY - The features to ratelimit by. Specifying multiple features (Ip, Machine) will group by each specific pair. MAX - The maximum number of actions allowed during the time period. In this case the first three events will not be ratelimited, but the fourth and onwards will. EVERY - How often the ratelimit will be reset. Valid timespan units are MONTHS, WEEKS, DAYS, HOURS, MINUTES, SECONDS. In this example, we&#x2019;re rate limiting by Ip address, and allow a maximum of three signups every ten minutes. If a given IP is used in an action four or more times in a 10 minutes window, then we mark the address that is used with a &#x201C;possible_bot&#x201D; label. Feature combinations Our previous rate limiter does a decent job of slowing down bots, but it&#x2019;s prone to false positives if an IP is shared amongst lots of users (like a university wifi access point). To reduce the false positive rate, we can increase the maxAmount for our existing NumSignups_TenMinutes_Ip rate limiter, and create a more strict rate limiter on a combination of features. For example, let&#x2019;s make a new rate limiter that limits how often the actions may be taken on the pair (Ip, UserAgent). To implement this, every unique user agent appearing on a given IP gets its own quota. With our previous rate limiter, all user agents appearing on a given IP share a single quota. 1 2 3 CREATE RULE QuickSignupsByUserAgentOnIp WHERE rateLimited(BY Ip, UserAgent MAX 3 EVERY 10 MINUTES); WHEN QuickSignupsByUserAgentOnIp THEN addLabel(Ip, possible_bot); Conditionals Often you only want to rate limit under certain conditions. We provide a WHERE statement inside the rateLimited clause that will allow you to check if the user was rate limited but only in the specified condition. An easy example of where that is useful is high value payments. The rule described below will allow any number of payments under $100, but only a maximum of two payment over that per day. 1 2 3 LET IsHighDollarPaymentAmount := PaymentAmountUsd = 100; CREATE RULE MultipleHighValuePurchasesByActorDay WHERE rateLimited(BY Actor MAX 2 EVERY DAY WHERE IsHighDollarPaymentAmount); A strikes system example You can use rate limiters to build advanced policies, such as a strikes system for rules. If you already have a rule in place and you want to give the user (or IP, or any combination of features) &#x201C;3 strikes&#x201D;, simply do the following: 1 2 CREATE RULE ThreeStrikesCheating WHERE rateLimited(BY Actor MAX 2 EVERY WEEK WHERE Cheated); We leave it up to the user to define the Cheated feature. To get started on that though you&#x2019;ll want to review our features documentation. Conditional rate limiters behavior Sometimes you may only want a rate limiter to run if a given condition is met. For example, perhaps we want to limit the number of high-value purchases a user can make. 1 2 3 LET IsHighDollarPaymentAmount := PaymentAmountUsd = 100; CREATE RULE MultipleHighValuePurchasesByActorDay WHERE rateLimited(BY Actor MAX 2 EVERY DAY WHERE IsHighDollarPaymentAmount); The statement above will allow each Actor to make a maximum of 2 payments for $100 or above each DAY. Once a specific Actor has made the two payments in one day the rate limit will be triggered and any future payments (even if they are less than $100) will be flagged. Conditions inside and outside of the rateLimited clause The position of the IsHighDollarPaymentAmount inside or outside of the rateLimited() function changes the behavior. As an example, within one twenty-four hour period a user made the following payments in order: $110, $30, $10, $120, $200, $50. 1 rateLimited(BY Actor MAX 2 EVERY DAY) AND IsHighDollarPaymentAmount This would fire on all payments over $100, after the user had made two previous purchases that day. In the example given, it would fire on the $120, and $200 payments. 1 rateLimited(BY Actor MAX 2 EVERY DAY WHERE IsHighDollarPaymentAmount) This would fire on all payments, after the user had made two previous purchases for over $100. In the given example, it would fire on the $200 and $50 payments. 1 rateLimited(BY Actor MAX 2 EVERY DAY WHERE IsHighDollarPaymentAmount) AND IsHighDollarPaymentAmount This would fire on all payments over $100, after the user had made two previous purchases for over $100. In the given example it would only fire on the $200 purchase. Leaky buckets Up until this point, we&#x2019;ve created rate limiters that refill their entire quota at the end of each period. It&#x2019;s often more effective to utilize &#x201C;leaky bucket&#x201D; quota refills, where the quota slowly builds up over an extended period rather than all at once. This severely punishes attackers who continue to go over their quota, while minimizing the impact on legitimate behavior. Let&#x2019;s add a leaky bucket rate limiter on the Simhash of every comment posted. A Simhash is a fuzzy text fingerprint of the comments text. By ratelimiting on that we ensure that the same (or very similar) text may only be sent a limited number of times by any actor throughout the system. This is a powerful way to automatically stop large-scale spam attacks without writing custom text content rules or rate limiting the actor, IP, or other connection characteristics. The following rate limiter limits an individual fuzzy text fingerprint may only be used 100 times a minute, and if the quota is exceeded the rate limit goes down to 10 times a minute. 1 CREATE RULE NumCommentsSimhash WHERE rateLimited(BY Simhash MAX 100 REFILL 10 EVERY MINUTE); Strict mode Often when you create a ratelimit (such as the one above) you want to penalize the rate limited entity once their quota has been exhausted. To accomplish this, Smyte has created a special STRICT mode. Once an entity has been rate limited in STRICT mode they will be rate limited until the entire refill time period has passed. 1 CREATE RULE UserCommentBot WHERE rateLimited(BY Actor MAX 5 EVERY MINUTE STRICT);"},"counters/ratelimit.html#Rate-limiters":{"title":"Rate limiters","path":"/sqrl/counters/ratelimit.html#Rate-limiters","body":"One of the most powerful ways to stop abuse is to create rate limiters.

Let&#x2019;s get started with a simple count. Your first counter Here&#x2019;s an example of a simple counter that counts the number of action by a given User in the last week. 1 2 LET User := input(); LET NumMessages := count(BY User LAST WEEK); Pairwise features You can create a counter by one or more features. In the above example for each unique User we have created another counter of the number of actions performed in the last week. For certain use cases you&#x2019;ll want to count pairwise features. Perhaps you&#x2019;ll want to know the number of messages the given user sent on this Ip as compared to the number they have sent total. That is easy to do just by comma separating the features. 1 2 3 4 5 LET Ip := input(); LET User := input(); LET NumMessages := count(BY User LAST HOUR); LET NumIpMessages := count(BY User, Ip LAST HOUR); LET PercentMessagesByIp := 100 * (NumIpMessages / NumMessages); Available timespans The LAST clause specifies the timespan we want to count by. For simple counters we do not allow custom timespans, even though we do for unique counts. The list of available timespans are: TOTAL LAST MONTH LAST TWO WEEKS LAST EIGHT DAYS LAST TWO DAYS LAST DAY LAST HOUR Note: TOTAL counts will still expire after 90 days if they have not been seen for that period. Conditions It is very easy to create more interesting counters by passing in a WHERE statement as well. Let&#x2019;s imagine you were interested in tracking users who had a high percentage of messages with profanity. We could easily accomplish this by tracking two counts. 1 2 3 LET TextWithStrongProfanity := random()  0.5; # You can use pattern matches for this LET NumMessagesWithProfanity := count(BY User WHERE TextWithStrongProfanity LAST WEEK); LET NumMessagesWithoutProfanity := count(BY User WHERE NOT TextWithStrongProfanity LAST WEEK); Here we have set up two counters &#x2013; NumMessagesWithProfanity will be increased when the text contains profanity, otherwise NumMessagesWithoutProfanity will be increased. Both counters are available to be read on every action. Restrictions on conditions in WHERE clauses For reasons discussed under where expressions in our advanced documentation there are strict restrictions on what you can put in a WHERE clause.

In this post we will explore how sessionization works and some interesting properties associated with sessions. What is a session? A session is &#x201C;a unit of measurement of a user&#x2019;s actions taken within a period of time or with regard to completion of a task.&#x201D; In other words, sessions allow us to cluster activity from a particular time window together. SQRL (the Smyte Query and Rules Language) allows you to easily create sessions using custom keys across arbitrary timespans in real-time as your data streams in. Smyte&#x2019;s definition of a session is slightly broader in that we do not restrict sessions to just users. In fact, we can create sessions that are keyed off of IP addresses, credit cards, URLs, or any feature for that matter without having to wait for complex, expensive batch jobs to run. Getting started Let&#x2019;s imagine a simple case where we wanted to create a one hour session for a user. We can accomplish this with a single line of code: 1 LET UserHourSession := sessionize(BY User EVERY 1 HOUR); From now on, whenever the user performs an action (logs in, sends a message, makes a payment, etc) we will check to see if a session exists. If no session exists, we will create a session that lasts for one hour. Creating a one hour session If the specified time elapses with no activity, the current session is destroyed. Any subsequent event will create a new session. Creating a new session after too much time has elapsed If the session does exist, then we will extend the current session&#x2019;s window by an additional hour. Extending a session It is important to note that each session gets its own unique ID. This identifier can be used in simple counters, unique counters, or rate-limits to identify suspect behavior and can even be used to determine the age of the session since we embed timestamps in all Smyte IDs. Conditional sessions In our first example, we created a simple session with no conditions; however, we can easily add qualifiers with a WHERE clause. Let&#x2019;s imagine we want to create a session for any time a user sends a message. We could accomplish this with the following line of code: 1 LET UserMessageHourSession := sessionize( BY User EVERY 1 HOUR WHERE ActionName = send_message ); In this case, we only consider message events as valid actions to be grouped in a session. Detecting bots As mentioned above, Smyte tracks session age through unique IDs. To show how this is useful in detecting bots, let&#x2019;s consider the example above. If we call the dateDiff function, we can see how many hours have elapsed since the session was created. Session age 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 LET UserMessageHourSession := sessionize(BY User EVERY 1 HOUR WHERE ActionName=send_message); -- Get session age in hours LET MessageHourSessionAgeInHours := dateDiff( HOUR, UserMessageHourSession, EventTimestamp ); Remember that as soon as an hour has elapsed with no activity the session is destroyed and a new one will be created. This means that if a user has a message session that is 24 hours old they have been actively sending messages for the past 24 hours straight! This type of behavior often indicates that the user is in fact a bot. With this insight, you can easily create a rule to flag and review this suspicious behavior.

We were eventually purchased by Twitter and the service was shut down. By the end, SQRL &#x2013; the Smyte Query and Rules Language &#x2013; was protecting over 150m monthly active users. Tens of thousands of rules were running on thousands of events per second and were maintained by almost 50 customers over the course of 3 years. It lives on today inside of Twitter at an even larger scale. Like most startups, we began with the simplest and cheapest solution: we let our customers write their rules in JavaScript. This worked for a while, but led to a number of issues: Maintainability. Rules rapidly change and are often maintained by nonprogrammers, so the codebase quickly became a mess. Auditability. It was difficult to understand why a rule fired after the fact, since the JS code grew to be very complex. Performance and cost. The rules often had to query multiple databases and downstream services, and we couldn&#x2019;t control the latency vs cost trade-off without editing our customer&#x2019;s code (which we often didn&#x2019;t understand). Safety. It was easy for rule authors to make a mistake and exhaust CPU or storage resources. A few of us are ex-Facebook, so we knew that Haxl , a Haskell dialect, solved some of these issues. However, we had to empower our customers &#x2013; many of whom barely knew SQL, much less JavaScript or Haskell &#x2013; to be able to write and maintain rules, so Haxl was out.

There wasn&#x2019;t an existing solution that was powerful enough to solve the problems our customers had (for example, a lot of alternatives are stateless) and was safe enough to put in the hands of a bunch of nonprogrammers at third parties. Guiding principles 1. It should never take down the site. SQRL does not have loops or recursion and therefore does not have the halting problem. SQRL talks to downstream services and data stores in a declarative way, making it difficult &#x2013; if not impossible &#x2013; to overload dependent services. SQRL expressions may be eagerly or lazily evaluated as decided by the runtime, meaning that latency vs cost trade-offs can be tweaked over time without changing the rules. SQRL fails gracefully. When an error occurs in a subexpression, the rule can often still partially complete. In cases where it can&#x2019;t, SQRL fails open. SQRL can be given a latency budget and will stick to it. SQRL executes in a secure sandbox and is appropriate for multitenant applications. 2. It should look like SQL. SQRL should be readable by anyone. For example, lawyers often want to audit which rules are running, and customer success reps want to know why a particular transaction was declined or user was actioned. SQRL should be writable by anyone who barely knows SQL or Excel. SQRL is dynamically typed. Stateful features &#x2013; like counters, rate limiters, blacklists, etc &#x2013; should be expressed declaratively rather than imperatively. 3. It should be easy to understand why a rule fired. Rules have associated docstrings that can be rendered in a GUI. SQRL can be statically analyzed. SQRL is pure, which means you can replay rules later and capture the output as well as all of the side effects. SQRL does not have user-defined functions, nor does it have a call stack. 4. It needs to be &#x201C;flexible enough&#x201D;. SQRL needs to fulfill the day-to-day needs of our spam, abuse, and fraud-fighting customers without changing the language or standard library. SQRL needs to be able to deployed quickly enough to mitigate an ongoing incident. It should take just a few minutes to wire up new event types. SQRL needs to be portable to other runtimes.

Before we begin, let&#x2019;s go over a few concepts. SQRL takes an event, called an action , and turns it into one or more features (some special features are also called rules , but we&#x2019;ll get to that later). Your server-side application will usually send an action to a SQRL service, and do something based on the results of the features (i.e. show the user a warning or queue something for manual review). An action is something the user did, or is about to do. For example, some common events include login , signup , post_comment , and add_payment_method . Actions are just JSON blobs that we call ActionData . For example, one of the most important actions at Twitter is tweet : 1 {name: tweet, username: floydophone, text: hello world!} Save that JSON blob into a file called tweet.json . We&#x2019;ll need it later. Wiring up features Now let&#x2019;s wire up some basic features in SQRL. Features are similar to variables in other languages. You can bind them using the LET keyword, and can reference them in any expression. Open up your favorite editor (hint: it&#x2019;s emacs) and create a file called main.sqrl with the following code in it: 1 2 3 4 LET ActionData := input(); LET ActionName := jsonValue(ActionData, $.name); LET Username := jsonValue(ActionData, $.username); LET Text := jsonValue(ActionData, $.text); jsonValue() is a builtin function that parses a JSON string and returns the value at the given JSONPath . Note that SQRL is smart enough to only parse the JSON once. Let&#x2019;s fire up the repl and play with it. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 $ npm install -g sqrl $ sqrl repl main.sqrl -s ActionData=@tweet.json sqrl Username &apos;floydophone&apos; sqrl Text &apos;hello world!&apos; sqrl ActionName &apos;tweet&apos; sqrl ActionData { name: &apos;tweet&apos;, text: &apos;hello world!&apos;, username: &apos;floydophone&apos; } sqrl SqrlClock &apos;2019-02-21T09:15:45.615Z&apos; sqrl SomethingElse Error: Could not find the requested name:: SomethingElse Cool! You&#x2019;ll see that the features were extracted successfully, and that there&#x2019;s a built-in (but overridable) SqrlClock feature that represents the event time. Note also that features are case sensitive. The current SQRL implementation runs on Node.js and is a compiler, not an interpreter. As we&#x2019;ve run this at scale for a long time at a startup that needed to conserve cash, we&#x2019;ve put in some effort to make this JS as efficient as we could. You can see a readable version of the compiled code for a feature by calling printSource() : 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 sqrl printSource(Username); function() { const f0 = () = bluebird.resolve( functions.attr(this.slots[ActionData].value(), username) ); return this.load(ActionData).then(f0); } We can also spin up a SQRL service to serve this code over the network: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 $ sqrl serve main.sqrl &amp; $ curl -H Accept: application/json &apos;http://localhost:2288/run?features=Username,Text,ActionName&amp;pretty&apos; -d @tweet.json { Username: floydophone, Text: hello, world!, ActionName: tweet } We call this process of unpacking a JSON object into feature names wiring up the action . You usually do this work once per action type. Once an action is wired up, all of your existing features and rules will automatically start to work on the new action. Let&#x2019;s say that we want to identify cryptocurrency spam on Twitter. A useful thing to know would be if the user is tweeting about specific cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin (BTC) or Ethereum (ETH). Let&#x2019;s create a feature for that in the REPL: 1 2 3 4 sqrl LET HasCryptoKeywords := Text CONTAINS BTC OR Text CONTAINS ETH; false sqrl Text CONTAINS world true Counters Now let&#x2019;s say we want to count how often someone is tweeting about cryptocurrency. We&#x2019;ll need to use a stateful feature like a counter. Let&#x2019;s create a new feature NumCryptoTweetsLastDay : 1 2 sqrl LET NumTweetsAboutCrypto := count(BY Username WHERE HasCryptoKeywords LAST DAY); 0 The value is 0 because there are no crypto keywords in our tweet.json file. Let&#x2019;s pretend that there are and see what happens: 1 2 3 4 5 6 sqrl LET HasCryptoKeywords := true; true sqrl NumTweetsAboutCrypto 1 sqrl NumTweetsAboutCrypto 1 Now the value is 1 because the tweet HasCryptoKeywords . But note that even though we evaluate the feature multiple times, the count doesn&#x2019;t go up. That&#x2019;s because SQRL is idempotent . This is a valuable property because it allows us to reprocess actions at a later time if we need to. The SQRL repl has an EXECUTE command that will actually update the state and begin the processing of a new action: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 sqrl EXECUTE; sqrl NumTweetsAboutCrypto 2 sqrl NumTweetsAboutCrypto 2 sqrl EXECUTE; sqrl NumTweetsAboutCrypto 3 sqrl EXECUTE; At this point, we can flip HasCryptoKeywords back to false, and the counter will cease to increment. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 sqrl LET HasCryptoKeywords := false; false sqrl NumTweetsAboutCrypto 3 sqrl EXECUTE; sqrl NumTweetsAboutCrypto 3 This is what we mean when we say SQRL is a stateful rules language, and it&#x2019;s what sets it apart from many other rules languages. Another thing to note is that the rule writer declaratively specified what they wanted to count. They didn&#x2019;t explicitly increment or decrement the counter. It&#x2019;s impossible for the counter to accidentally get out of sync, and the backend can be swapped out for a different data store without changing the SQRL source code. At Smyte, we did this at least four times: we moved from a quick and dirty Redis-based counters implementation, to RocksDB, and finally to Google Cloud BigTable. We also had a separate in-memory implementation for unit tests. If you wait 15 minutes, this counter will eventually decrement. But why wait? All you need to do is change SqrlClock to be 15 minutes or more into the future and the counter will drop: 1 2 3 4 sqrl LET SqrlClock := 2100-02-13T08:00:00.000Z &apos;2100-02-13T08:00:00.000Z&apos; sqrl NumTweetsAboutCrypto 0 This is super useful for replaying old actions or writing unit tests. Text pattern matching As we all know, cryptocurrencies come and go&#x2026; often. We may want to keep a list of known crypto keywords that people can update rather than requiring a code change all the time. First, make a file CryptoKeywords.txt containing: 1 2 btc eth And then in the repl: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 sqrl LET HasCryptoKeywords := patternMatches(CryptoKeywords.txt, Text); false sqrl patternMatches(CryptoKeywords.txt, buy some eth!) true sqrl patternMatches(CryptoKeywords.txt, buy some ETH!) true sqrl patternMatches(CryptoKeywords.txt, hi, seth!) false Note that patternMatch() understands word boundaries in multiple languages, so that &#x201C;hi, seth!&#x201D; won&#x2019;t trigger a false positive. Writing a rule Now let&#x2019;s say we want to limit people to 100 crypto tweets a day. We&#x2019;d never write a rule like this in the real world, but it&#x2019;s a useful example of what&#x2019;s possible. Rules are just boolean features with some extra metadata and a nice syntax. Here&#x2019;s how you&#x2019;d do it. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 sqrl CREATE RULE TooMuchCrypto WHERE NumTweetsAboutCrypto  10 WITH REASON User ${Username} tweeted about crypto ${NumTweetsAboutCrypto} in the last day; sqrl TooMuchCrypto false sqrl LET NumTweetsAboutCrypto := 11; 11 sqrl NumTweetsAboutCrypto true Side effects Your rule should actually do something. Perhaps we want to label every user that is tweeting too much about crypto for manual review. You can do this with a WHEN block. A WHEN block ORs together a set of rules, and runs a side effect when one or more of those rules fire. For example, if you had an addUserToReviewQueue() function defined, you could call it like this: 1 WHEN TooMuchCrypto THEN addUserToReviewQueue(cryptospam); The fuction addUserToReviewQueue() is not included with the default SQRL distribution, but if you have a review queue set up with an API, you can easily define a new when clause function .

Before we begin, let&#x2019;s go over a few concepts. SQRL takes an event, called an action , and turns it into one or more features (some special features are also called rules , but we&#x2019;ll get to that later). Your server-side application will usually send an action to a SQRL service, and do something based on the results of the features (i.e. show the user a warning or queue something for manual review). An action is something the user did, or is about to do. For example, some common events include login , signup , post_comment , and add_payment_method . Actions are just JSON blobs that we call ActionData . For example, one of the most important actions at Twitter is tweet : 1 {name: tweet, username: floydophone, text: hello world!} Save that JSON blob into a file called tweet.json .

SQRL has a number of features that we think are cool and/or unique. Parallelizable data fetching Data fetching is implicit and can be parallelized. The runtime can decide whether to fetch eagerly or lazily to balance speed vs cost as needed without changing the source of the rule. This is similar to a number of projects, including Haxl , but isn&#x2019;t part of any mainstream languages to our knowledge. No halting problem SQRL does not have recursion or unbounded loops, meaning that we can know that the program will halt. No call stack SQRL does not have user-defined functions. Introducing user-defined functions can often lead to difficult to understand code for nonprogrammers. Entities as first-class citizens SQRL has a notion of an &#x201C;entity&#x201D;, which is a type (i.e. &#x201C;EmailAddress&#x201D;) and a string key (i.e. &#x201C; foo@bar.com &#x201C;). It gets a stable 64 bit ID called a UniqueId where the most significant bits of the ID are the timestamp that the ID was created. Subsequent references to the same ( type , key ) pair will get the same UniqueId . This has many advantages: We often use entities as keys in databases, and a 64 bit UniqueId requires less storage than the full entity key . Storing an opaque UniqueId instead of the string key limits the proliferation of personal data across different databases. We automatically know the date that we first saw an entity with no additional storage. We use this signal often in the anti-spam, anti-fraud and security domains that SQRL is primarily used in. If the UniqueId is used as a database key, most databases will store entities in chronological order (i.e. B-trees and LSM-trees, the most popular type of DB indexes, store rows in key-sorted order). When doing spam, fraud, or security investigations, you usually want to query the oldest or newest entities of a given type, which won&#x2019;t require a separate (slow) sort step since they&#x2019;re already sorted. This has proven to be incredibly useful and we think it&#x2019;s unique to SQRL. Declarative state SQRL functions like count() track their own state declaratively, rather than requiring the rule author to write rules to explicitly mutate state.
