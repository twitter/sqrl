# SQRL

This project is a skeleton for a documentation website using [Hexo](https://hexo.io) and [hexo-theme-doc](https://github.com/zalando-incubator/hexo-theme-doc).   
You can use it to quickly bootstrap your documentation website.

The seed contains the required structure and files to use Hexo and the theme, plus dummy content to show the usage of the main features of the theme.

## Getting Started

To get started have a look first to the [requirements](https://zalando-incubator.github.io/hexo-theme-doc/get-started.html#Requirements), then install `hexo-cli` with:

```bash
$ npm install -g hexo-cli
```

Now just clone `hexo-theme-doc-seed` repository:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/zalando-incubator/hexo-theme-doc-seed.git <directory>
```

Go into the resulting directory and install dependencies:

```bash
$ npm install
```

Start the preview server locally with:

```
hexo s
```

> If you open your browser at http://localhost:4000 you should see the documentation website up and running.
